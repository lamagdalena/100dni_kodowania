During winter when the nights are long and days short, getting up for work in the dark and coming home in the dark can be grim. Some of us succumb to the January blues, leading to increased illness, reduced productivity and a general feeling of melancholy. But can clever lighting improve our sleep patterns and lift our moods? I only feel like I start to breathe properly again after the solstice, says Jacqueline Hazelton, a professor at the US Naval War College in Rhode Island. She's referring to the winter solstice - usually 21 December - the point after which the days start lengthening again following the longest night of the year. I'm happier and more productive on sunny days year round, she says, but a string of dull days puts a real crimp in my productivity. Most of us are affected by the change in seasons and the amount of natural light we experience, says the mental health charity Mind. Some are particularly badly affected. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) - depressive feelings associated with a particular time of year - affects 9.5% of people in northern Finland and 9.9% in Alaska, but only 1.4% in sunny Florida, researchers say. And this winter much of Europe has been especially dark. Moscow enjoyed only six minutes of sunshine in December - it normally experiences 18 hours.
